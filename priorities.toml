# Agentic Attention System — Priority Configuration
#
# Controls how Claude Code hook events route to sounds, symbols,
# and tab titles. Edit patterns and symbols to tune what gets
# your attention while working alongside an AI agent.
#
# Patterns are regex (case-insensitive), matched against Claude's
# last assistant message. Tiers checked top-to-bottom: first match wins.

[project]
# Regex applied to file paths in the session transcript.
# First capture group = project name shown in the tab.
# Set this to match your directory structure:
#   'projects/([^/]+)/'      — projects/my-app/ → "my-app"
#   'packages/([^/]+)/'      — monorepo packages
#   'clients/([^/]+)/'       — client work folders
#   'Work/([^/]+)/'          — Obsidian vault with Work/ClientName/ folders
#   'src/([^/]+)/'           — flat src directory per module
